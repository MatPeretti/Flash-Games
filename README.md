# Project preview
The "Flash Games" project was developed as part of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course. It consists of two classic games: a Hash Game and a Memory Game. Both games are implemented using JavaScript to provide interactive and enjoyable gaming experiences.

# Introduction
"Flash Games" project is a collection of two simple yet entertaining games designed to be played directly in a web browser. The project demonstrates the use of HTML to structure the games' layout, CSS for styling them, and JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity.

The goal of this project is to provide users with an enjoyable gaming experience while also showcasing fundamental web development skills using the three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
